# Object-Detection-IOT
For an advanced object detection project with the ESP32, I've envisioned integrating an ultrasonic sensor alongside the ESP32-CAM module.<br>
This configuration will allow the ESP32 to not only capture images but also gauge distances, significantly enhancing its detection capabilities.<br> 
By linking the ultrasonic sensor to the ESP32, we'll enable real-time distance measurements, which, when combined with image processing from the camera module, will provide a comprehensive understanding of the environment.<br>
With the Arduino IDE as our development platform and tailored libraries for both the ultrasonic sensor and ESP32-CAM, we'll craft a sophisticated object detection system. This amalgamation of hardware and software promises versatility, making it adaptable for diverse applications, from smart surveillance to interactive installations.
